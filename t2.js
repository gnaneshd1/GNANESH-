This innovative approach helps protect plants during winter, while creating a spectacular display that attracts visitors.
//Chrysanthemum cultivation in the district spans several villages, including Kyadigere, Chikkenahalli, Doddasiddavvanahalli, Kusuvanahalli, Hunasekatti, Kallahalli in Chitradurga taluk, and Nelagattanahalli and others in Challakere taluk.
//Previously, farmers harvested chrysanthemums only during Deepavali and Dasara festivals, limiting them to a single crop. Now, Chitradurga farmers cultivating the Cent Yellow breed of chrysanthemum achieve three harvests annually, although they face challenges in protecting their crops during the winter months.
//The Cent Yellow chrysanthemum variety flowers throughout the year, providing farmers with a steady income. "Farmers are required to set up LED bulbs to produce light and heat for the plants to avoid diseases and grow in short duration to get a better yield. The LED light works like medicine and generates heat for the plants," asserted an officer from the department of horticulture.`
